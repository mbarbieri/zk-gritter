ZK Gritter for ZK 3.6
=====================

ZK Gritter is a [ZK](http://www.zkoss.org/) component to show Growl-like notifications.

It uses [Gritter for jQuery](https://github.com/jboesch/Gritter) and is heavly based on [Gekkio's jawwa](https://github.com/Gekkio/jawwa)  solution but is compatible only with ZK 3.6 (not 5 or above).
